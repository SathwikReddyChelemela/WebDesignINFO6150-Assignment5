## SCSS Features <a name="scss-features"></a>

In this project, we have leveraged several powerful SCSS (Sass) features to enhance code organization and maintainability:

1. **Variables**: Store and reuse values for consistent styling.
   - Example: `$font-family-playfair: 'Playfair Display';`

2. **Custom Properties (CSS Variables)**: Define global properties for flexible styling.
   - Example: `--background-color: #000000;`

3. **Nesting**: Organize styles for nested elements within their parent selectors.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     header {
       #favi {
         // Nested styles here
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Interpolation**: Generate dynamic CSS classes or selectors based on variables.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     @mixin imgN1N2($n) {
       .N#{$n} {
         // Dynamic styles here
       }
     }
     ```

5. **Placeholder Selectors**: Define styles that can be extended in other selectors.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     %border-radius {
       border-radius: 10px;
     }
     ```

6. **Mixins**: Create reusable style blocks for inclusion in other selectors.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     @mixin center {
       text-align: center;
       margin: 0 auto;
     }
     ```

7. **Functions**: Use custom functions to calculate or return values.
   - Example:
     ```scss
     @function bolder($weight: 6) {
       @return bolder;
     }
     ```

8. Additional SCSS Features

I  mentioned adding 3-4 more SCSS features. Here are a few additional features you could consider:

Extending Selectors: You can extend one selector with another to avoid repeating styles.

Sass Variables and Maps: Utilize more complex variables and maps for storing and managing data.
example:font-size: map-get($font-sizes, small);

Control Directives: Used @if, @for, and other control directives for more advanced logic in your styles.
        example: @if $apply-special-styles 
        example:@for $i from 1 through length($column-colors)

SCSS File Organization: Used @import, to organize your SCSS files into partials and imports to keep your codebase modular and maintainable.
       example: @import'feature.scss';



Folder Structure :

The project code is thoughtfully organized into distinct folders to streamline code management:

UI elements: This folder houses SCSS files dedicated to specific UI components, such as the header, summary, sidebar, and grid.
Common Elements: Within this folder, you'll find SCSS files that define common styles, variables, and mixins, allowing for their easy reuse throughout the project.
Features : This folder can be utilized for SCSS files related to theming if you decide to implement them in the future.
